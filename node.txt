                - An endpoint in an API (Application Programming Interface) is a specific URL or URI
                  (Uniform Resource Identifier) that represents a resource or service provided by the
                  API. It is the point of entry for clients to access the functionality provided by the API.

                - Endpoints are typically defined by HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

                - https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}
                    In this case, {user_id} would be replaced with the actual ID of the user being requested.
                    
                - Endpoints can also include parameters that modify their behavior. For example:
                    https://api.example.com/products?category=electronics
                    In this case, the "category" parameter is used to filter products based on their category.
